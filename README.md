# ArmÂ® for Nova
This extension provides syntax highlighting support for the Arm assembly language in [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/). It is based off of my extensions for [VSCode](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/vscode-arm), [Atom](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/language-arm), and [Sublime Text](https://github.com/dan-c-underwood/ARM-ASM-Sublime), which in turn were based off of drd's fork of foxostro's x86 Assembly bundle for Sublime Text, which was developed from amorrow's PIC Assembly bundle. (Long history!)

I will continue to update this package, and will try to backport changes to the VSCode and Atom packages where possible - although there will be variations in what the editors support.
